            <p>
              This project was written in JavaScript, html and CSS. I created 10
              questions and you must answer them in the time allowed. If you get
              the question correct you get 1 point if you miss the quesiton you
              get 10 seconds taken away from the timer. At the end of the quiz
              you can enter your initials and your score will save in local
              storage so next time you take the quiz you can see how you did the
              first time.

              This is a daily scheduler that will allow you to enter text into
              each hour of the day, it was developed with JaveScript, bootstap,
              jquery, local storage and calling an api to get the time of day
              and date which will update daily. You can enter an event each hour
              and the day is color coded so you know what hour your in if it's
              red, gray means it's past that time of day and green is in the
              future.
